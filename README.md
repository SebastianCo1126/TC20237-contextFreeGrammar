### Generating and Cleaning a Restricted Context Free Grammar

I chose to generate the grammar to create a simple, indefinite, one-varable integral. 
This is to be constructed with constants (numbers 0...9), the variable x, the integral symbol
which in this case is going to be represented by a back slash '\', the exponentiation 
symbol '^' and finally the differential 'dx'. All of this to construct our grammar. 

  // Some examples of how the grammar could generate include: 

  - \ 2x^2 dx + \1 dx
  - \ 58x^5 dx - \ 6x^2 dx + \ 7 dx
  - \ 15x^2 dx + 17x^8 dx - \ 10 dx

The complexity of integral expressions can go an extremely long way by introducting 
definite integrals. Double or even triple integrals, and by having more than one variable. 
This gets complex real quick, so the grammar was shortened to only accept one variable
definite integrals due to this. 

With the previous context in mind, we can create this using a RCFG (Restricted Context
Free Grammar). A context free grammar (according to Geeks for Geeks) is "Context Free 
Grammar is formal grammar, the syntax or structure of a formal language can be described 
using context-free grammar (CFG), a type of formal grammar. The grammar has four tuples: (V,T,P,S)." 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-context-free-grammar/

  A -> bAcD
  D -> aaCb
  C -> b

  * in this example, the uppercase letters represent non-terminals, the lowercase letters
    represent termials and each line represents a rule. 

A restricted CFG is just a CFG that has additional restrictions to make it simpler. 
This is what I will be working with for this evidence. So first I will construct a base 
grammar that will be ambiguous and left-recursive. Then I'll clean the grammar in order to 
have it ready for it to be parsed using nltk in python. 


### Model of grammar

First we need to **generate a generic grammar that recognizes de language**. 
Rochester University states that a CFG must contain the following: 

- "A set of terminal symbols, which are the characters of the alphabet that appear in the strings generated by the grammar."
- "A set of nonterminal symbols, which are placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols that can be generated by the nonterminal symbols."
- "A set of productions, which are rules for replacing (or rewriting) nonterminal symbols (on the left side of the production) in a string with other nonterminal or terminal symbols (on the right side of the production)."
- "A start symbol, which is a special nonterminal symbol that appears in the initial string generated by the grammar."

This was the first approach to generating a grammar.

- S -> INT EXPR DIFF
- EXPR -> T
- T -> VAR | CONST | T_L | T_R | EXP
- T_L -> VAR T_L | CONST T_L | EXP
- T_R -> T_R VAR | T_R CONST | T_R EXP | ε
- INT -> '\'
- DIFF -> 'dx'
- VAR -> 'x'
- CONST -> '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
- EXP -> '^' T | ε

This grammar is problematic as we have two main issues. Ambiguity and left recursion. 
Ambiguity happens because we can reach the same output through various different ways. 
In this case the rules T_L and T_R are able to get the same result, just the former 
through left most derivations and the latter through right most derivation. So this 
introduces ambiguity. And on the rule T_R you access yourself first on the right hand side, 
leading to a potential infinite loop, hence left recursion. Now let's clean this grammar.

In this image we can see that we can create to different trees to arrive to the same result of 
\ 2x^2 dx, which indicates ambiguity. This is because the grammar was written to have right 
and left most derivation. Now let's remove ambiguity first by just sticking to one 
way of derivation. And let's take care of left recursion as well, present in: 

  - T_R -> T_R VAR | T_R CONST | T_R EXP | ε

As T_R can be called indefinetly. So re-working the grammar first we add the posibility of 
concatenating the expressions with + or -, as the previous grammar only considered one expression:

  - S -> E
  - E -> P E'
  - E' -> P '+' E | P '-' E | ε
  - P -> INT T DIFF

Next, letst just stick to one way of derivation, and add a way for constants to access a variable 
after them with or without and exponent: 

  - T -> VAR EXP | CONST T'
  - T' -> VAR EXP | ε

And with that we can add the rest of the variables that just access the different terminals: 

  - INT -> '\'
  - DIFF -> 'dx'
  - VAR -> 'x'
  - CONST -> '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
  - EXP -> '^' T | ε

Finally we construct our unambiguous, and non-left-recursive grammar, in which I additionaly
I substituted the integral symbol for a '%' for better readability in the tests: 

- S -> E
- E -> P E'
- E' -> P '+' E | P '-' E | ε
- P -> INT T DIFF
- T -> VAR EXP | CONST T'
- T' -> VAR EXP | CONST T | ε
- INT -> '%'
- DIFF -> 'dx'
- VAR -> 'x'
- CONST -> '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
- EXP -> '^' T | ε

Nos using Princeton University's LL(1) visualization tool 
(available in https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos320/LL1/) 
we can check if the grammar is correct. The followinf is how the grammar was written 
in a syntax for the website: 

- E ::= P E'
- E' ::= + E 
- E' ::= - E
- E' ::=  ''
- P ::= INT T DIFF
- T ::= VAR EXP 
- T ::= CONST T'
- T' ::= VAR EXP 
- T' ::= CONST T
- T' ::= ''
- INT ::= \
- DIFF ::= dx
- VAR ::= x
- CONST ::= 0 
- CONST ::= 1
- CONST ::= 2
- CONST ::= 3
- CONST ::= 4
- CONST ::= 5
- CONST ::= 6
- CONST ::= 7
- CONST ::= 8
- CONST ::= 9
- EXP ::= ^ T

It passed the test, and is availbe as an LL(1). First here are the 'First and Follow table':

And the transitions table, which is cropped as it didn't completely fit on the screenshot, but the rest 
of the columns are just other constants:

Here is a test for the \ 2x^2 dx expression.

And another one for a concatenated integral \ 2x^2 dx + \ 7 dx:

Finally a test passed for a more complex concatenated integral \ 81 x^8 dx - \ 721 x^2 dx + \ 5 dx:
